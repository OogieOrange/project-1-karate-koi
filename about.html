                Karate means "empty hand" and is a unarmed martial-arts discipline. Employing kicking,
                striking and defensive blocking using both arms and legs. Striking surfaces used in karate
                include the hands (in particularly the knuckles and the outer edge), heel, forearm, knee,
                and elbow. Traditionaly these areas are toughened by practice blows against surfaces or wood.
                Pine boards up to several inches in thickness could, and can, be broken by the bare hand or
                foot of an expert karateka (one who practices karate). Timing, tactics, and spirit however,
                are each considered at least as important as physical toughening.
            </p>
            <p>
                Karate was developed in East Aisa over centuries, becoming systematized into
                a concrete martial art in Okinawa inthe 17th century. During the 1920s karate
                was imported to Japan. Resulting in several schools and systems developing and
                favoring somewhat different techniques and training methods. Even if this caused
                the creation of branches to the sport, things like core values, rituals and
                disciplines remained the same across them.
            </p>
            <p>
                Karate, like other Asian martial-arts disciplines, puts a stress on mental attitude,
                rituals of courtesy, siuts (called "Gi"), and a complex ranking system (carified by
                colour of belt).

            <p>
                At Karate Koi we focus on building a welcoming and accepting comunity. We want
                everyone to feel at ease walking through the doors to our dojo.
            </p>
            <p>
                We train Shotokan Karate according to the rules and guidelines set by the JKA
                (Japan Karate Association). This means that we dress in the traditional white
                dress, "Gi", during training, and concentrate on bare hand striking and blocking
                techniques.
            </p>
            <p>
                Fitting training clothes, for those that do not own a "Gi", is training trousers
                and a t-shirt. You are however encouraged to procure a "Gi" as soon as possible.
                The beginner group is led by a more experianced member and lasts for one hour.
            </p>
            <p>
                We have different training times depending on what level you are on. So if you have
                prior experiance with training karate, we ask that you contact us to se which group
                you should join.
            </p>
            <p>
