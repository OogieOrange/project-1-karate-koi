                Karate means "empty hand" and is a unarmed martial-arts discipline. Employing kicking, 
                striking and defensive blocking using both arms and legs. Striking surfaces used in karate 
                include the hands (in particularly the knuckles and the outer edge), heel, forearm, knee, 
                and elbow. Traditionaly these areas are toughened by practice blows against surfaces or wood. 
                Pine boards up to several inches in thickness could, and can, be broken by the bare hand or 
                foot of an expert karateka (one who practices karate). Timing, tactics, and spirit however, 
                are each considered at least as important as physical toughening.
            </p>

                Karate was developed in East Aisa over centuries, becoming systematized into 
                a concrete martial art in Okinawa inthe 17th century. During the 1920s karate 
                was imported to Japan. Resulting in several schools and systems developing and 
                favoring somewhat different techniques and training methods. Even if this caused 
                the creation of branches to the sport, things like core values, rituals and 
                disciplines remained the same across them.

                Karate, like other Asian martial-arts disciplines, puts a stress on mental attitude, 
                rituals of courtesy, siuts (called "Gi"), and a complex ranking system (carified by 
                colour of belt).
