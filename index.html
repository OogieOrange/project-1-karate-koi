                <h2>Why Karate?</h2>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Karate is, like many other sports, beneficial for the body. 
                    The training helps develop agility, strength and speed. 
                    While also improving muscle tone and endurance. 
                    Doing karate means you work with both the hands and feet, 
                    left and right sides equally. Doing this promotes balance and 
                    inevitably increase mental and physical coordination, as well as flexibility. 
                    Training in general can also help in developing more confidence and 
                    self-esteem in all parts of life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What can seperate karate from for example footbal is the disceplined 
                    and respectful 'etiquette' that is encouraged towards instructors and 
                    fellow students alike. This teaches us to apply a good character even 
                    outside of training. The self-discepline that is inevitably developed through training 
                    also contributes to a certain restrain and self-control that can be 
                    applied outside the dojo.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The way we treat others in training translates 
                    into how we treat others and ourselves in the real world.
